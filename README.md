A machine learning-based network traffic classifier built using the NSL-KDD dataset. This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that can classify network traffic as benign or malicious.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç Real-time network traffic classification
- üìä Interactive visualization of results
- üíæ Export functionality for classified data
- üìà Feature importance analysis
- üéØ Built on the NSL-KDD dataset

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HexHawk/NIDS-Classifier.git
cd NIDS-Classifier
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv nids_env
source nids_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: nids_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the NSL-KDD dataset:
   - Download `KDDTrain+.txt` from [NSL-KDD dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)
   - Place it in the project root directory

## üöÄ Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

3. Upload your network traffic CSV file (must contain NSL-KDD features)

4. Click "Classify" to analyze the traffic

## üìä Data Format

Your input CSV must contain the following NSL-KDD features:

### üåê Basic Connection Features

These features are derived from packet-level network connection attributes:
